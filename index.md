The MDB Tools project is a effort to document the MDB file format used in Microsoft's Access 
database package, and to provide a set of tools and applications to make that data available on other platforms.

Specifically, MDB Tools includes programs to export schema and data to other databases such 
as MySQL, Oracle, Sybase, PostgreSQL, and others.

Also included is a SQL engine for performing simple SQL queries. The 0.5 release includes an 
updated GUI interface ([screenshot](/images/gmdb2screenshot.png)). A sparse but functional ODBC driver is included as well.

MDB Tools currently has read-only support for Access 97 (Jet 3) and Access 2000/2002 (Jet 4) formats. Write support 
is currently being worked on and the first cut is expected to be included in the 0.6 release.
